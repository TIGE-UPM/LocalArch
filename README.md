## 1. Downloading the app

In order to download the app, first the repository must be cloned. Then, inside the cloned folder, the ``npm install`` command must be executed. This command will install all the dependencies of the app.

<div id="launch"></div>

## 2. Launching the app

In order to launch the app after downloading the repository, you must first execute the ``npm start`` command. This command initiates the server that compiles React whenever a change is detected. Additionally, in a separate terminal, the ``npm run electron-dev`` command should be executed. This command starts the Electron app, which displays the React interface.
